a simple python script that prompts the user to enter a url for a YouTube video, then it displays the last 10 comments on that video 

note: you will have to get a YouTube API key then write that key in the appropriate place inside the script for the code to work.
if you get this error:
no module named 'google'

then run this and it should be fixed:
'''pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client'''
